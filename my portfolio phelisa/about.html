<p> My name is Phelisa Sodzeme i live in litha park khayelitsha,
 i matriculated last year at Oval North High in Mitchells Plain. Telling you about my strengths
 am a dedicated worker towards my work.I enjoy putting myself in competitions as i enjoy workng
with people and helping them where i can.Am a good listener and adviser,i enjoy learning from others and experience new things.
I tend the be shy around people that i never met before, i dont like people that disrespect others because respect goes in both ways.
Am loud sometimes but also quiet.I always isolate myself at places where am not needed.
Am good at many things be it at dancing,singing,sports or anything that got to do with physical activities.
I love children,helping others when they are in need of help. </p>
